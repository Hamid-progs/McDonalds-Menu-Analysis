# 🍔 Menu Data Analysis with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib & MySQL

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis pipeline using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **MySQL** on a real-world restaurant menu dataset. It includes data cleaning, visualization, categorization and insights generation.

## 📂 Dataset

- File: `menu.csv`
- Contains menu items along with their nutritional information (calories, fat, sugar, sodium, etc.)

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Removing extra characters (e.g., "oz", "g") from serving sizes  
   - Converting values into numerical formats

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Labeling high-calorie items  
   - Categorizing fat content as Low, Medium, or High using NumPy

3. **Data Visualization (Matplotlib)**  
   - Bar charts of calories per item  
   - Pie charts of calorie contribution by category  
   - Line plots for sugar and sodium across items  
   - Histograms for calorie distribution
